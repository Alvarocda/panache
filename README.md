# Panache aka Flutterial 

A [Flutter](https://flutter.io) [Material Theme](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/ThemeData-class.html) editor. 

Panache helps you to create beautiful [Material](http://material.io) themes for your Flutter applications.
Customize components colors and shape, and export the generated theme.dart to your Google drive.

Most of the code is in [panache_lib](https://github.com/rxlabz/panache_lib)
